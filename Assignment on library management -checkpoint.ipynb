    "Scenario:\n",
    "You are tasked with designing a simplified library management system in Python for a local library. The system needs to manage books, library members, and their borrowings. Implement the following classes based on the requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class: Book\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties: title, author, ISBN, is_available.\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "__init__(self, title, author, ISBN): Initializes the book with the title, author, and ISBN.\n",
    "borrow(self): Marks the book as borrowed (is_available = False) if it is available.\n",
    "return_book(self): Marks the book as available (is_available = True).\n",
    "Encapsulate the properties to prevent direct modification from outside the class.\n",
    "Class: Member\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties: name, member_id, and borrowed_books (a list of borrowed book instances).\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "__init__(self, name, member_id): Initializes the member with a name and ID.\n",
    "borrow_book(self, book: Book): Allows the member to borrow a book. Adds the book to borrowed_books if the book is available.\n",
    "return_book(self, book: Book): Allows the member to return a borrowed book and remove it from their borrowed list.\n",
    "Class: Staff (Inherits from Member)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Property: position.\n",
    "Additional Method:\n",
    "__init__(self, name, member_id, position): Initializes the staff member with a name, member ID, and position.\n",
    "Class: Librarian (Inherits from Staff)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Method:\n",
    "add_book(self, book: Book): Allows the librarian to add new books to the library collection.\n",
    "Polymorphism Requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a method get_details(self) in both Member and Staff classes to return information specific to that class.\n",
    "For Member, it should return the member's name and ID.\n",
    "For Staff, it should additionally return the staff's position.\n",
    "Abstraction Requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an abstract base class LibraryUser with abstract methods borrow_book and return_book. Both Member and Staff should inherit from LibraryUser and implement these methods.\n",
    "Task:\n",
    "Write the code to implement the scenario above, demonstrating the following OOP concepts:\n",
    "Encapsulation: Use private attributes and provide getters and setters if needed.\n",
    "Inheritance: Show the use of inheritance with Staff and Librarian classes.\n",
    "Polymorphism: Demonstrate how get_details behaves differently for Member and Staff.\n",
    "Abstraction: Use the abstract base class LibraryUser to enforce the interface for borrowing and returning books."
